Condeco web and mobile apps have the Report Issue button, that opens the Eptura Asset request Portal. Employees can report maintenance issues with a resource and information automatically passed from Condeco to Eptura Asset. The integration enables efficient data transfer, enhances collaboration and communication, and centralizes maintenance issue management within Eptura Asset."
