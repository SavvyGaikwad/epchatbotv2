Having accurate counts helps to identify inventory loss, trends in demand, and reduce stockouts due to discrepancies. When you want to create a new cycle count, there are various ways you can select the parts: Bin Location Only - Create a Cycle Count using only Bin Locations and no additional filters. High Cost Per Item - Create a count list for high-cost parts by setting a minimum part cost. Inventory Shortages - Count parts with qualities below their minimum stocking level. Not Recently - Count parts that have not been counted since a selected date. Part Type - Count parts based on a specific Part Type. I want to pick specific pars on the cycle count itself"
