Usage: Helps in identifying how many assets are undergoing repair or maintenance due to failures. This can aid in prioritizing maintenance efforts and assessing the overall reliability of assets. Example: If there are 15 assets with open work orders categorized under Failure Codes, the Asset Failure KPI will show 15. This indicates that there are 15 assets with ongoing issues that need to be addressed."

It provides insight into the immediate impact on production or operations. Usage: Helps in understanding the availability and performance of assets. If a high number of assets are down, it may signal the need for improved maintenance strategies or resource allocation. Example: If the KPI shows 8 assets down, it means 8 assets are not operational at the moment due to various reasons like scheduled maintenance or unexpected breakdowns."

The X-axis represents the count of work orders, and these are further categorized by work type within each asset category. On click will filter out the grid accordingly.\n\nExplanation Purpose: To visualize and analyze the volume of work orders based on asset categories and their respective types.\n\nUsage: Helps in identifying which asset categories have the most work orders and what types of work are most frequent (preventive, breakdown, maintenance, etc.). This information can be used to optimize maintenance strategies and resource planning.\n\nExample: For the asset category Vehicle, if the chart shows 10 work orders, and these are divided as 3 Preventive Maintenance, 4 Breakdown, and 3 General Maintenance, you can see not just the total work order count but also the nature of the issues being addressed.\n\nExample Breakdown:\nVehicles: (Asset category)\n- Total Work Orders: 10\n- Preventive Maintenance: 3\n- Breakdown: 4\n- General Maintenance: 3\n\nVisualization: The bar for Vehicles category on the chart will be a total height of 10. This bar is segmented into three parts: The first segment (3 units high) represents Preventive Maintenance work orders. The second segment (4 units high) represents Breakdown work orders. The third segment (3 units high) represents General Maintenance work orders."

These assets are considered not utilized. On click will filter out the grid accordingly.\n\nExplanation Purpose: To identify assets that are not being used as expected or not having their usage tracked properly.\n\nUsage: Helps in recognizing underutilized or potentially neglected assets, prompting a review of asset utilization practices. Regular updates are crucial for accurate asset management.\n\nExample: If an asset has a meter reading that hasn’t been updated for over a month (as per the number of days set in work order settings log reset days), it is flagged as “not utilized,” suggesting that the asset may either be idle or that its usage data is not being recorded properly."

This can indicate the potential need for replacements or upgrades.\n\nUsage: Helps in understanding the longevity of assets and planning for future capital expenditures. Older assets might require more maintenance or replacement sooner.\n\nExample: If the average manufacture date of assets is calculated and found to be 5 years, it means, on average, the assets in the inventory are 5 years old."

By comparing costs month-over-month or year-over-year, organizations can identify trends, forecast future expenses, and implement cost-saving measures.\n\nExample: If this month’s maintenance costs are $10,000 compared to $8,000 last month and $12,000 in the same month last year, it provides insights into recent changes in maintenance spending and helps in financial planning."
